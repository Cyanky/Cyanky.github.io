[{"title":"AWS-CloudFormation","url":"/posts/4d8d16f5/","content":"<h2 id=\"AWS-CloudFormation\"><a href=\"#AWS-CloudFormation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"AWS CloudFormation\"></a>AWS CloudFormation</h2><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Omppm_YUG2g\">CloudFormation</a> is a tool for creating, managing, configuring, and deploying cloud resources. Like any other AWS service, CloudFormation can be used via either the CLI or web-console.</p>\n<p>This tool is particularly beneficial if you have to provision a set of cloud resources <strong>multiple times</strong>, at <strong>scale</strong>. You can do so by simply writing (YAML or JSON) scripts that you can easily edit and run numerous times.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The (JSON or YAML) script file is also called the <strong>CloudFormation template</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the script, we mention each resource’s necessary configuration that we want to provision and then use either the CLI commands or web-console to execute the scripts.</li>\n<li>You can still individually manage AWS resources that are part of a CloudFormation stack.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"What-is-a-CloudFormation-template\"><a href=\"#What-is-a-CloudFormation-template\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is a CloudFormation template?\"></a>What is a CloudFormation template?</h3><p>It is a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/gettingstarted.templatebasics.html\">YAML or JSON script</a> that defines the collection of AWS resources that you want to create in just one command. Defining a particular resource means declaring the</p>\n<ul>\n<li>name of the resource,</li>\n<li>type of resource, and</li>\n<li>assigning the necessary properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, the properties of a resource vary from one <em>type</em> to another, for example, the properties of an IAM role will be different from an S3 bucket. Let’s see an example CloudFormation template below that is defining a VPC with a <code>10.0.0.0/16</code> block (i.e., a virtual network with 65,536 private IP addresses):</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">AWSTemplateFormatVersion:</span> <span class=\"number\">2010-09-09</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">Description:</span> <span class=\"string\">Udacity</span> <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">This</span> <span class=\"string\">template</span> <span class=\"string\">deploys</span> <span class=\"string\">a</span> <span class=\"string\">VPC</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">Resources:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"attr\">myUdacityVPC:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">Type:</span> <span class=\"string\">&#x27;AWS::EC2::VPC&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">Properties:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"attr\">CidrBlock:</span> <span class=\"number\">10.0</span><span class=\"number\">.0</span><span class=\"number\">.0</span><span class=\"string\">/16</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"attr\">EnableDnsHostnames:</span> <span class=\"string\">&#x27;true&#x27;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In simple words, a VPC is a virtual network defined by a range of IP addresses allocated to you. These IP addresses are by-default private to you, meaning no one will be able to accesss these IP addresses from the outside-world. You can associate any of these IP addresses to the resources, such as Database, server, load-balancer, cluster etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The template above is defining the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>default template format, as <code>2010-09-09</code></li>\n<li>name of the resource, as <code>myUdacityVPC</code></li>\n<li>type of resource, as <code>&#39;AWS::EC2::VPC&#39;</code></li>\n<li>Property fields, such as <code>CidrBlock</code>, and <code>EnableDnsHostnames</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certainly, there could be many more property-fields that you can use if needed. And, as mentioned earlier, the properties of a resource vary from one <em>type</em> to another.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not copy-paste the template shown above because a YAML file is indentation-sensitive.

For example, the group of resources could comprise a VPC, one or more EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM roles, or any other AWS resource.</p>\n<p>This collection of resources that get created using a single script, is considered a one-logical entity called <strong>a stack</strong>.

IAM is a global service and is automatically available across <strong>all AWS regions</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AWS IAM service securely controls access to AWS resources by authenticating and authorizing (giving granular permissions) the individual users, applications, or services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let’s learn about key IAM terms.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-IAM-User\"><a href=\"#1-IAM-User\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1. IAM User\"></a>1. IAM User</h4><p>A user is a unique identifier generated by the IAM service and recognized by all AWS services to grant access to AWS resources. A user can be a person, system, or application that requires access to AWS services. You can generate login credentials and access keys for any user in your account. Roles and policies control the scope (permissions) of a user’s access to AWS resources in your account.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2-IAM-Group\"><a href=\"#2-IAM-Group\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2. IAM Group\"></a>2. IAM Group</h4><p>A group collects IAM users with the same level of permissions to access AWS resources. You can attach or detach permissions to a group using access control policies. A group makes it easier to manage IAM users with the same level of permissions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3-IAM-Role\"><a href=\"#3-IAM-Role\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3. IAM Role\"></a>3. IAM Role</h4><p>A role is simply a set of policies (permissions) to access AWS services. You can assign a role either to an IAM user or an AWS service such as EC2. Creating and storing roles helps to delegate access with defined permissions without sharing long-term access keys.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"Difference-between-an-IAM-role-and-an-IAM-user\"><a href=\"#Difference-between-an-IAM-role-and-an-IAM-user\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Difference between an IAM role and an IAM user\"></a>Difference between an IAM role and an IAM user</h4><p>An IAM user has permanent credentials that can be used to interact with AWS services directly. In contrast, an IAM role does not have any credentials; hence it cannot make direct requests to AWS services. IAM roles are assumed by authorized entities, such as IAM users, applications, or other AWS services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"4-IAM-Policy\"><a href=\"#4-IAM-Policy\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"4. IAM Policy\"></a>4. IAM Policy</h4><p>An access control policy is a JSON file that defines the resource to grant access, level of access, and allowed actions. In simple words, a policy defines the permissions to access a resource. You can attach a policy to multiple users, groups, or roles to assign permissions to AWS resources.</p>\n<p>AWS offers predefined policies that are managed by AWS. You can even create, save, and attach custom policies, as shown below</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/5ff5b2d0_screenshot-2021-01-06-at-6.08.07-pm/screenshot-2021-01-06-at-6.08.07-pm.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing creating a custom policy in the AWS web console\"></p>\n<p>Create a custom policy using either a visual or a JSON editor</p>\n<p>See a sample IAM policy that allows full EC2 access within a specific AWS region.

Just as with containers, a single physical machine (the host machine) can run many virtual machines to scale the number of isolated applications. While virtual machines work well for scaling applications, since they virtualize an entire machine, they can be resource-intensive. This is where containers can be an improvement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>How multiple VMs are managed on a host machine?</strong><br>Each VM has a complete OS, and multiple VMs can run on the same host. The host operating system runs the VMs using a <strong>hypervisor</strong>, which is special software that creates and manages the VMs. The hypervisor maintains the isolation of the VMs with each other.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>How multiple containers are managed on a host machine?</strong><br>Containers bundle together an application with its dependencies. Unlike VMs, containers do not have a separate OS or virtualized hardware. They share a single operating system kernel. In practice, the containers are managed by a <strong>container manager</strong>, which serves a role analogous to the hypervisor in a VM scenario.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"How-to-create-VMs\"><a href=\"#How-to-create-VMs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to create VMs?\"></a>How to create VMs?</h4><p>If you want to create a VM (a complete computer) locally, you can use either of the following software (called Hypervisors):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine\">Microsoft Hyper-V</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html\">Oracle VM VirtualBox</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vmware.com/\">VMWare</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.parallels.com/\">Parallels Desktop</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not get into the details and types of hypervisors because it is beyond this course’s scope.

A few of the benefits of using Kubernetes (k8s) are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ease of scaling the container instances up or down to meet varying demands (horizontal scaling).</li>\n<li>It can balance loads, and perform health checks.</li>\n<li>It helps in setting-up inter-container communication (networking).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kubernetes was born out of the lessons learned in the <a href=\"https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444\">Scaling containerized apps at Google</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Benefits-of-using-Kubernetes\"><a href=\"#Benefits-of-using-Kubernetes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Benefits of using Kubernetes\"></a>Benefits of using Kubernetes</h3><p>A few more benefits of using Kubernetes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High availability architecture</li>\n<li>Auto-scaling</li>\n<li>Rich Ecosystem</li>\n<li>Service discovery</li>\n<li>Container health management</li>\n<li>Secrets and configuration management The downside of these features is the high complexity and learning curve of Kubernetes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Key-Terms\"><a href=\"#Key-Terms\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Key Terms\"></a>Key Terms</h3><ul>\n<li><em>Cluster</em>: A group of machines running Kubernetes</li>\n<li><em>Master</em>: The system which controls a Kubernetes cluster. You will typically interact with the master when you communicate with a cluster. The master includes an api, scheduler, and management daemon.</li>\n<li><em>Nodes</em>: The machines in a cluster.

It is a logical group of containers on a node that runs a particular module&#x2F;application. A pod consists of one or more containers, shared storage resources, and a unique IP address. Note that all the containers within a Pod share the namespaces and filesystem volumes. Pods are not persistent, and may be brought up and down by the master during scaling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Kubernetes-Cluster-Architecture\"><a href=\"#Kubernetes-Cluster-Architecture\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Kubernetes Cluster Architecture\"></a>Kubernetes Cluster Architecture</h3><p>The core of Kubernetes is the cluster. A cluster comprises several node machines for running containerized applications and a master for managing the nodes. Each node is capable of running multiple <em>pods</em> (a group of containers). Therefore, each node has a container runtime, such as Docker, installed on it.</p>\n<p>The diagram below shows a simplistic view of a Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/September/5d71adc3_image2/image2.png\" alt=\"Kubernetes clusters consist of a master system, nodes and pods\"></p>\n<p>Kubernetes clusters consist of a master system, nodes, pods, and services.</p>\n<p>Note the following points about the Kubernetes architecture:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nodes are managed by the Master system. <strong>Each node in the cluster must have a container runtime, such as Docker.</strong></li>\n<li>A given node can host multiple PODs.</li>\n<li>The PODs (a logical group of containers) are running independent modules of an application. In the last lesson, it was a single container running a module.</li>\n<li>The PODs are replicated across multiple nodes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can view a detailed version of the cluster architecture <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Reliability\"><a href=\"#Reliability\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Reliability\"></a>Reliability</h3><p>In the cluster diagram shown above, each POD runs a specific module (App A, App B, App C…) of an application. Moreover, the PODs are not attached to a specific node (host). Instead, multiple nodes are hosting similar PODs. This architecture mitigates the chances of a single point of failure, and thus provides high availability. The master system brings a layer of abstraction for the external client&#x2F;application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Service-and-Volumes\"><a href=\"#Service-and-Volumes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Service and Volumes\"></a>Service and Volumes</h3><p>All pods that are running the same application module share storage resources. Further, all the containers within a pod share the namespaces and filesystem volumes. Hence, in order to have a persistent way to store data, volumes can be attached to pods.</p>\n<p>Whereas, in order to have a persistent way to communicate with ephemeral pods, a higher-level service abstraction is provided, called <em>Kubernetes Service</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Service</em>: An abstraction of a set of pods and interface for how to interact with the pods</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/September/5d71ad55_l2-deployment-2/l2-deployment-2.png\" alt=\"Kubernetes pods with a connected service and volume\"></p>\n<p>Kubernetes pods with a connected service and attached volume</p>\n","categories":["Server Deployment"],"tags":["Server Deployment"]},{"title":"Test-Anatomy of Java","url":"/posts/f5f5a5e6/","content":"<h1 id=\"Function\"><a href=\"#Function\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Function:\"></a><strong>Function</strong>:</h1><p>the smallest building block in java programs, to perform a task ( the button on the  remote control of TV )  </p>\n<h1 id=\"the-parts-of-a-function\"><a href=\"#the-parts-of-a-function\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"the parts of a function\"></a>the parts of a function</h1><ol>\n<li><p><strong>Return Type</strong> : <strong>void</strong>&#x2F;value&#x2F;…  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>the name of the function</strong>: send email…( clearly identifies the purpose of the function)  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>parenthese</em> <strong>(parameters)</strong>: who’s the receiver what is the subject&#x2F;content of the email   </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>a pair of curly braces</em> <strong>{</strong> <em>&#x2F;&#x2F;put the left brace on the same line where we define our function in Java</em><br>… the actual Java code <strong>method in Java</strong> (the function that is part of a class)<br><strong>}</strong>  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>main function</strong>: every Java program need at least one function called this, is the entry point to our programs whenever we execute a Java  program.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>class</strong>: a <strong>container</strong> for one or more related functions.
